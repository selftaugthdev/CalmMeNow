# Implementation Notes

## Core Logic
Each emotion button triggers:
1. A corresponding audio file playback using `AVAudioPlayer`.
2. Optionally tracks the selected emotion in a state variable.

## Audio Playback
- Use AVFoundation to play bundled `.mp3` files.
- Ensure fallback if playback fails.

## Onboarding
Simple `NavigationStack` or `fullScreenCover` from `App.swift`:
- Use `@AppStorage("hasLaunchedBefore")` to check if onboarding is needed.

## Breathing UI
- Use `withAnimation` and `Circle()` in SwiftUI for inhale â†’ hold â†’ exhale cycle.

## Navigation Flow
1. Home â†’ AudioPlayerView â†’ FeedbackView
2. If "Still overwhelmed" â†’ BreathingView

## Sound Storage
Bundle `.mp3` files inside the app to avoid download needs.
```
